Welcome to my website! I am a recent graduate of the University of Toronto, recieving a BSc in Global Health with minors in Economics and Statistics. \newline

I love coding in R and enjoy coding ShinyApps! In my 'free' time, I am a competative water polo goalie who has represented Canada on an internation scale and recently recieved the Frank Pindar female Athlete of the Year at the University of Toronto. 

Currently, I am a research assistant at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and have been volunteering at St. Michael's Hospital doing statistical data analysis.
